# Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Introduction
This project applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a simple grid world. We use the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT) algorithm. UCT is the most popular MCTS algorithm.

The implementation is based on [A Survey of Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods](http://mcts.ai/pubs/mcts-survey-master.pdf).
